# Nuremberg Address Knowledge Graph

The Nuremberg Address Knowledge Graph is part of the ongoing TRANSRAZ project. It contains 860K triples on persons and organizations in the Nuremberg address book of 1910. This contribution is valuable for historical scientists and digital humanists intending to study citizens' names, historical occupations as well as companies and their distribution in Nuremberg. After its integration into the 3D VRE of TRANSRAZ, the address book data can be explored by researchers as well as the general public.
