# Transraz

[TRANSRAZ](https://www.fiz-karlsruhe.de/en/forschung/transraz) is an ongoing research project aiming at connecting heterogeneous historical data collections to an architectural 3D virtual research environment (VRE) using KGs. 
The overall goal is to enable the exploration of the historic city of Nuremberg in different time periods ranging from the Middle Ages to the 21st century.

## NA-KG
Currently, the Nuremberg Address Knowledge Graph is under development which contains information about people and organizations in Nuremberg during 1910. 
The NA-KG can be accessed [here](https://github.com/ISE-FIZKarlsruhe/Transraz/tree/main/NurembergAddressKG).
